🛒 Superstore Sales Analysis using Python

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetic Superstore sales dataset generated using Python. It includes a complete data cleaning pipeline followed by in-depth analysis such as univariate, bivariate, time series, category-wise, and regional analysis using Python libraries.
This project helped me gain strong hands-on experience in real-world data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

🎯 Objectives
Generate a realistic Superstore sales dataset using Python.
Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis.
Perform detailed EDA to uncover insights.
Visualize trends and patterns.
Strengthen practical knowledge of Python for data analytics.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas – data manipulation & cleaning
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib – basic visualization
Seaborn – statistical visualization
Jupyter Notebook – analysis environment

📂 Dataset
The dataset is synthetically generated to mimic real Superstore sales data.
Features:
Order ID
Order Date, Ship Date
Category, Sub-Category
Region, State
Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure data quality:
✅ Handled missing values (imputation/removal)
✅ Removed duplicate records
✅ Converted date columns to datetime format
✅ Corrected data types for numerical columns
✅ Treated outliers in Sales & Profit
✅ Standardized category and region names
✅ Created new features (e.g., Order Month, Year)
📌 Purpose: Prepare reliable data for accurate analysis and insights.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1️⃣ Univariate Analysis
Distribution of Sales, Profit, Quantity
Category and Region frequency
Histograms & count plots
📊 Understand individual variables.

2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis
Sales vs Profit
Discount vs Profit
Category vs Sales
Scatter plots & box plots
📊 Explore relationships between variables.

3️⃣ Time Series Analysis
Sales trends over time
Monthly/Yearly aggregation
Seasonal patterns
📈 Analyze growth and seasonality.

4️⃣ Category Analysis
Sales & profit by Category and Sub-Category
Top and bottom performing segments
📦 Evaluate product performance.

5️⃣ Regional Analysis
Region-wise and state-wise sales & profit
Contribution analysis
🌍 Assess geographic performance.

📊 Key Insights
Technology and Office Supplies are major revenue contributors.
Higher discounts often reduce profitability.
Clear upward sales trend with seasonal spikes.
West and East regions outperform others.
Few sub-categories drive majority of profits.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Built a complete EDA pipeline from raw to insights
Strong data cleaning & preprocessing skills
Advanced Pandas operations
Effective data visualization
Business-oriented analytical thinking
